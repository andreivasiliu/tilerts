Things I need to solve:
* Coordinate system
* Collision detection, if any
* Collision shapes
* Physics, if any
* Nudging, if any
* Path-finding
* Map structure

### Coordinate system

* Most likely 2D tiles, although units must be able to occupy multiple tiles.
  * Although is that really necessary?
  * Not really, but it would look too ugly.
  * What if unit tiles were much bigger than map tiles though?
  * That is actually acceptable. Hmm.
